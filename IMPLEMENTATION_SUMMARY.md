### Phase 4: ReactJS Frontend Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- **Project Structure:**
  - Vite-based React application with modern tooling
  - TypeScript-free implementation (using JSX only)
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
  - Component-based architecture

- **Core Features:**
  - React Router for client-side navigation
  - Authentication context with protected routes
  - Notification context for real-time updates
  - Comprehensive API service layer with Axios
  - Base layout with header, sidebar, and main content

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
